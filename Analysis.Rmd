##Making survey design object
```{r}
survey_design = 
  svydesign(id = ~verep, strata = ~vestr,
            weights = ~ANALWT_C, nest = T, data = NSDUH_analysis)
```

#Estimating Means

```{r}
svymean(~NSDUH_analysis$catage, design = survey_design)
svymean(~newcig, design = subset(survey_design, catage > 1))
svymean(~NSDUH_analysis$newcig, design = survey_design)

```

##ended up quitting here
Returning to sas to use known code because this isn't working.
